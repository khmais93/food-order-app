# Food order app

Food order app is an I build based on the [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux) project build by Maximilian Schwarzmüller.
In this project, I used Redux, Axios and Lodash. most of the styling is provided by Max.Schwarzmüller. All the JS was written by me.
